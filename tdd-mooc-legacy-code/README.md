# [TDD MOOC](https://tdd.mooc.fi/): Legacy code

This is an exercise to practice dealing with legacy code. There are three things you need to do:

1. **Write test for the code [src/gilded_rose.js](src/gilded_rose.js), until it has 100% mutation test coverage.**
2. **Refactor the code to make it understandable.**
3. **Add the "conjured items" feature described in [Gilded Rose requirements](GildedRoseRequirements.txt).**

When writing the tests, at first use just line coverage (`npm run coverage`) to find non-tested lines. After all lines
are tested, switch to using mutation coverage (`npm run mutation`) and improve your tests. (In real projects, mutation
coverage typically takes many minutes to run, so it's impractical when you need fast feedback.)

When refactoring, first try to see how far you can get without understanding the problem domain (i.e. use mechanical,
provably correct refactorings). Then read the [Gilded Rose requirements](GildedRoseRequirements.txt) document to
understand the problem domain and get a new perspective for improving the design.
